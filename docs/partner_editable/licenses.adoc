This Quick Start requires a license for Microsoft SQL Server 2019. You can obtain a trial license from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019[Microsoft Evaluation Center^]. 

Alternatively, if you're not using the software for a production environment, you can use the MSSQL Developer Edition. This edition provides the full capabilities of Enterprise Edition without requiring license costs. 

This Quick Start deploys MSSQL in Bring-Your-Own-License mode. It does not support deployment of MSSQL license-included Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
