This Quick Start requires a license for Microsoft SQL Server 2019. A trial license can be obtained from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019[Microsoft Evaluation Center]. Alternatively, you can use MSSQL Developer Edition which provides full capabilities of Enterprise Edition but does not require license costs if not using for Production environment. This Quick Start assumes you use MSSQL in Bring-Your-Own-License mode. It currently does not support deployment of MSSQL License-Included AMI.
