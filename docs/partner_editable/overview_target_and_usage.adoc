This guide provides instructions for deploying the Quick Start reference architecture called {partner-product-name} on the AWS Cloudâ€”for short, {partner-product-short-name}. This guide does not provide general configuration and usage information for Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) and MSSQL. For general guidance and best practices, consult the Microsoft product documentation and the https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/best-practices-for-deploying-microsoft-sql-server-on-aws.pdf[Best Practices for Deploying Microsoft SQL Server on AWS^] whitepaper.

This Quick Start is for IT infrastructure architects, database administrators, and DevOps professionals who plan to implement or extend Microsoft SQL Server using https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sql/[SQL Server on AWS^] with WSFC.

SQL Server failover cluster instances have been traditionally difficult to deploy and manage. With the Multi-AZ file system option, https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/[Amazon FSx for Windows File Server^] provides fully managed file storage. This storage enables the high availability and durability that's required to run business-critical Microsoft SQL Server database workloads without the need for enterprise licenses. Amazon FSx automatically handles the data replication and failover, simplifying shared storage to host your database deployments while reducing cost.
