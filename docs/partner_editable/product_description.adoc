This Quick Start implements a highly available environment that includes Windows Server and SQL Server (MSSQL) running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), using the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/always-on-failover-cluster-instances-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15[MSSQL Always On Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) feature] and Amazon FSx as a network share for user database storage.  

The automation in this deployment uses AWS Systems Manager Automation, AWS CloudFormation, and Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) to deploy a multi-node SQL Always On failover instance cluster. A prerequisite for deploying a MSSQL Always On FCI is Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC). MSSQL uses WSFC to increase application availability. WSFC provides infrastructure features that complement the high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) scenarios supported in the AWS Cloud.

FCI was introduced with SQL Server 2008 as a high availability feature and continues to be available in all newer versions of MSSQL. When used on premises, SQL Server FCI is often purely a high availability solution within a single data center. In AWS, it is possible to use {partner-product-short-name} as a solution that covers both HA and Disaster Recovery (DR) requirements.

Implementing {partner-product-short-name} requires shared storage, which is the reason FCI traditionally had to be deployed within a single data center. In AWS, the shared storage can span across multiple Availability Zones, enabling FCI clusters to span across multiple Availability Zones.

Implementing WSFC in AWS is similar to deploying it in an on premises setting as long as two key recommendations are met:

* The cluster nodes are deployed inside a virtual private cloud (VPC).
* The cluster nodes are deployed in separate subnets to provide high availability across multiple Availability Zones.

This Quick Start provides an automated deployment of {partner-product-short-name} with Amazon FSx as shared storage leveraging WSFC that meets above mentioned requirements.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a reference architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS. It doesnâ€™t provide general configuration and usage information for WSFC and MSSQL. For general guidance and best practices, consult the Microsoft product documentation and the https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/best-practices-for-deploying-microsoft-sql-server-on-aws.pdf[Best Practices for Deploying Microsoft SQL Server on AWS] whitepaper.

This Quick Start supports SQL Server 2019 running on Windows Server 2019.
