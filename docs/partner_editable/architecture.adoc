As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Two EC2 instances running Microsoft Windows with SQL Server installed in an FCI configuration. 
* Amazon FSx with two file shares: one for user database storage and the other to act as the failover cluster witness.*
* AWS Directory Service with a managed directory.
* AWS Secrets Manager keys to store credentials.
* An AWS Systems Manager automation document to automate the deployment.
