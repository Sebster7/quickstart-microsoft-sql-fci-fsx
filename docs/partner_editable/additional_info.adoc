2. Open the *Settings* application.
3. Open *Update & Security*.
4. Click *Check for updates*.
5. Install any updates and reboot if necessary.

== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading

9. If you are able to log in then the deployment was successful.

== Troubleshooting

If the deployment fails, open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/home?region=us-east-1[Systems Manager console] and select your deployment Region. Select *Automation* from the left-hand side and locate the failed automation document. Navigate to the failed step and expand *Output* to view the automation logs. Follow the link to CloudWatch Logs to view detailed automation logs.
