This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, Managed Directory Service or self-managed Active Directory and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into existing VPC*.
* * *With AWS Managed Directory Service*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS VPC using existing AWS Managed Directory Service.
* * *With self-managed Active Directory into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS VPC using existing self-managed Active Directory.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide. If you select the template for existing VPC, there is also the option to join Amazon FSx and {partner-product-short-name} instances to an existing Active Directory domain. This existing AD can either be an instance of AWS Directory Service for Microsoft AD, or a self-managed AD running on-premises or running on EC2 instances.
