When deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start, you have three options:

* *Deploy it into a new VPC*. This option works with either AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD) or self-managed AD. It builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy it into an existing VPC using an existing AWS Managed Microsoft AD*. You can join Amazon FSx and {partner-product-short-name} instances to an existing Active Directory domain that's an instance of AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
* *Deploy it into an existing VPC using an existing self-managed AD*. You can join Amazon FSx and {partner-product-short-name} instances to an existing Active Directory domain that's an instance of a self-managed AD running on-premises or running on EC2 instances.

//TODO Dave, Please review the three revised bullets for clarity and accuracy.

//TODO Dave,  What can we say about Amazon FSx in the first bullet?

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and other settings, as discussed later in this guide.
