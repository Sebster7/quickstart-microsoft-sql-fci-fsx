When deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start, you have three options:

* *Deploy it into a new VPC*. This option works with either AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD) or self-managed Active Directory. It builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC. 
* *Deploy it into an existing VPC using an existing AWS managed directory*. With this option, you join Amazon FSx and the {partner-product-short-name} instances to an existing AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain.
* *Deploy it into an existing VPC using an existing self-managed directory*. With this option, you join Amazon FSx and the {partner-product-short-name} instances to an existing self-managed Active Directory running on-premises or running on EC2 instances.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and other settings, as discussed later in this guide.
