When deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start, you have three options:

* *Deploy it into a new VPC*. This option works with either AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD) or self-managed AD. It builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components, with FSx shares for database storage and file share witness. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy it into an existing VPC using an existing AWS Managed Directory*. You can join Amazon FSx and {partner-product-short-name} instances to an existing AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory domain.
* *Deploy it into an existing VPC using an existing self-managed AD*. You can join Amazon FSx and {partner-product-short-name} instances to an existing self-managed Active Directory running on-premises or running on EC2 instances.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and other settings, as discussed later in this guide.
